# Churn Predictions of international health insurance contracts

The goal of this sub-project is to predict if (/probability that) a contract will be terminated by the customer. In particular:
1. Which contrcats have the highest probability to get terminated by the customer?
2. What are main global impacts on contract terminations?
3. What are individual factors for customers to terminate their contracts?

Therefore different kinds of contract related information were extracted from the ERP System SAP B1 and processed in SQL to create a pseudonimised csv file with features per contract.

About the content:
- Samples of SAP and the preprocessing in SQL can be tracked in the subfolders __[images/ERP-System+SQL](/ChurnProject/images/ERP-System%2BSQL)__ and __[SQL](/ChurnProject/SQL)__.
- In __[images](/ChurnProject/images)__ screenshots and plots from dataviz & modelling can be found.
