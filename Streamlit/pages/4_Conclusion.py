## Results

### Sales Forecast:
- Time series: Old Model Zone ML like XGBoost or Random Forest Regressor are suitable. For New Model Zone only Mulitple Linear Regression is suitable.Â 
- Classification: KNN-model with Manhattan metric shows the best results; still the model cannot be applied in the business context.

            - Solid results, XGBClassifier most suitable for interpretation
            - Interesting Insights from SHAP
            - Too much focus on effective end
            - Limited business relevant success
