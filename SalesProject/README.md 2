SALES Project - Time Series - Prediction of Premium Amount with different models

![Time_Series_1](https://github.com/tis294/Sales_TimeSeries/assets/125119694/1d71e7a1-ef6d-42db-b82d-0b25f4dc06b4)




General: 
The basic idea of the project was to predict the premium amount with different time series models. Several models were tested and evaluated.  On the one hand the classical SARIMA model with only the change of the premium Amount. An additive and multiplicative model was tested and the time series was made stationary. In addition, other models such as Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Tree and XGBoost were run. Only the temporal and lag features were used as features. The individual models were evaluated with R^2 and RSME. The possibility of the Forecast was inserted. A recursive approach was chosen. The next month was estimated and taken over into the model. Finally, time series splits and grid search CV were performed. Due to the different zones within the data, there is the possibility to adapt the data to the different zones. 

Basis: monthly premium amount data in the period 2014-2022. 
Choice between multiple zones.
Models: SARIMA, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Tree, XGBoost
Features: Time Features (month, year, quarter), Lag Features (freely selectable)
Forecast: Recursive
Evaluation metrics: R^2, RSME
Optimization: Time Series Split
